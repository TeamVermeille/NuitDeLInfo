###About the project
The original goal of the PONG project was to design a new humanitarian platform for Organisations and institutions within the framework of the French national computer fair : La Nuit de l'Info 2014.  
As a growing necessity to take part to the numerical development of the humanitarian actions, we decided to implement a web application to help organisations with the tremendous amount of human collectable data. Several direct applications came to mind as we designed its specifications, as : 
* Population tracking
* Vaccination campaigns
* Prevention/Information  
  
The core idea of the PONG project was to implement a dynamic world map, where markers would pop when and where an event would take place, such as :
* A prevention campaign
* A natural disaster
* A humanitarian organisations/institutions meeting  
  
These markers could also display further information and redirect the user to a more detailed link.  
Around this idea, the application would also implement a HUB for organisations and institutions, featuring : 
* A rss flux newsfeed on recent humanitarian actions
* A database to better track people who enters camps
* Latest tweets (#humanitarian) from NGOs
* And why not : Population tracking data (graphs...), a NGO<->Media Platform to relay information to populations, a humanitarian version of `Kickstarter'... and so on !
  
###Actual implementation
We are aware that the specifications we gave to our project were way too large to be implemented in the given time (16 hours !). But we thought this would be interesting to actually write the ideas down and choose which ones we could implement.  
As only a couple members of our team have a decent web knowledge, we could not go as far as intended, and only did a basic database with a light website design for a start. More work needs to be done, but it's definitely an interesting project to develop.

###Communication Work
To better communicate about our project, we created several social networks references to the PONG Project :
