            About the project
The original goal of the PONG project was to design a new humanitarian platform for Organisations and institutions within the framework of the French national computer fair : La Nuit de l'Info 2014.  
As a growing necessity to take part to the numerical development of the humanitarian actions, we decided to implement a web application to help organisations with the tremendous amount of human collectable data. Several direct applications came to mind as we designed its specifications, as : 
* Population tracking
* Vaccination campaigns
* Prevention/Information  
  
The core idea of the PONG project was to implement a dynamic world map, where markers would pop when and where an event would take place, such as :
* A prevention campaign
* A natural disaster
* A humanitarian organisations/institutions meeting 

These markers could also display further information and redirect the user to a more detailed link.  
Around this idea, the application would also implement a HUB for organisations and institutions, featuring : 
* A rss flux newsfeed on recent humanitarian actions
* A database to better track people who enters camps
* Latest tweets (#humanitarian) from NGOs
* And why not : Population tracking data (graphs...), a NGO<->Media Platform to relay information to populations, a humanitarian version of `Kickstarter'... and so on !
